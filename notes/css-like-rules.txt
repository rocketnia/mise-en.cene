CSS properties for *an inline span of text*:

.blah {
    color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.0);
    text-size: 12px * user text size preference;
    reveal-speed: 10 graphemes per second * user text speed preference;
    reveal-speed: 10px per second * user text speed preference;
    reveal-speed: 10% of the graphemes of this span per second * user text speed preference;
    reveal-speed: 10% of the pixel length of this span per second * user text speed preference;
    rattling: 4 times per second;
    fast-forwardable: yes;
    fast-forwardable: no;
}

Properties of *a cue among inline spans* of text, including a cue at the beginning or end of a span:

(NOTE: Notes after each cue property are meant to suggest whether this would be a property of a span before or a span after the cue, if we changed the design so that it was a span property rather than a cue property.)

- Sound or animation to play, with a time offset to match up with
  - (This is usually useful next to whatever span of text will be entering as the sound or animation plays. If the user can fast forward, usually cues are most useful to align the beginning of a span with the beginning of a sound.)
- A time offset to wait for in a sound or animation that's already playing
  - (This is usually useful at the end of the span of text that's enters and waits during this part of the sound or animation.)
- Whether to wait for a button press
  - (This is usually useful after a span of text, to determine whether the user needs to hurry to read it.)

Those again as CSS properties:

.blah {
    cue-begin-sounds-and-animations-on-start: foo, bar, baz;
    cue-wait-for-end-of-sounds-and-animations-on-stop: foo, bar, baz;
    cue-wait-for-button-press-on-stop: yes;
    cue-wait-for-button-press-on-stop: no;
}

CSS properties for *a manually broken line of text*:

.blah {
    word-wrap: yes-and-button-press-for-more;
    word-wrap: yes-and-scroll-fast;
    word-wrap: no;
    span-direction: down-axis;
    span-direction: up-axis;
    align-spans-when-not-crowded: down-axis 0%;
    align-spans-when-not-crowded: with-span-direction 0%;
}

CSS properties for *a paragraph of text*:

.blah {
}

Properties of *a cue among paragraphs* of text, including a cue at the beginning or end of a paragraph:

- Whether to wait for a button press
  - (This is usually useful after a paragraph, to determine whether the user needs to hurry to read it.)

    cue-wait-for-button-press-on-stop: yes;
    cue-wait-for-button-press-on-stop: no;
}
